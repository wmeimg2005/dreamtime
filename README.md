Do you have any problem? Doubts? or you are simply interested in chatting with the main developer, any email (except SPAM) is welcome:

## F.A.Q.

**Q: Why does the program ask for firewall permissions?**

A: We use [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/) and [Nucleus](https://nucleus.sh/) to obtain telemetry information of the program mainly for automatic error reporting and to obtain real-time application information.

We do not store any personal information or photos that have been processed with the program, everything is kept securely on your computer, if you prefer you can use the program in offline mode or disable telemetry.
